# Beautiful Cart Page Integration Guide

I've created a beautiful cart page that offers a major visual and functional improvement over the existing cart page. The new cart page maintains all the functionality of the current implementation but with an enhanced UI.

## How to Use the New Cart Page

### Option 1: Direct Update (Recommended)

Replace the existing cart page reference in `main.dart` by editing line 5367 from:

```dart
const CartPage(),
```

to:

```dart
const BeautifulCartPage(),
```

And add this import at the top of `main.dart`:

```dart
import 'pages/beautiful_cart_page.dart';
```

### Option 2: Using the App Router

I've created an `AppRouter` class that you can use to navigate to the beautiful cart page:

1. Use the router in any navigation that redirects to the cart page:

```dart
import 'app_router.dart';

// Then replace:
Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const CartPage()));

// With:
AppRouter.navigateToCart(context);
```

## Features of the New Beautiful Cart Page

The new cart page includes:

1. **Modern sleek design** with animations and visual enhancements
2. **Improved product cards** with category badges
3. **Better empty cart UI** with clear call to action
4. **Enhanced order summary** showing tax and shipping details
5. **Beautiful checkout button** with elevated design
6. **Item deletion with undo functionality**
7. **Price formatting** improvements and clearer information hierarchy
8. **Smooth scrolling physics** for better interaction feel

All existing functionality is preserved, including:
- Adding/removing items
- Viewing totals
- Proceeding to checkout
- Managing quantities
- Navigating to product details
